    <p>
     This article focuses on what Reinforcement learning is in the modern sense. Though it is not scholoarly it is very helpful in explaining in detail how it works. It also has a section on robotics and how to use reinforcement learning to "learn optimal sequential actions to complete a task", which is one of the goals of our project

    <p>
      This paper highlights a similar project to ours in which they have a robot solve multiple mazes in different environments. The main goal of the project, quoted by the authors, is to have a  "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent able to ground natural language commands for navigating in arbitrary sized 3D maze(s)". They also talk about the multiple challenges that might be raised by this problem.
